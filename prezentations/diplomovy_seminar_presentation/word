Dear coleagues,
My name is vladimir Macko and I would like to presend you with my diploma thesis.

First i will introduce you to problem of document classification and word embeddings.
Then I outline some current problems of used approaches and our solutions tu them
Finally I presend how good are these solutions and what are our next plans.

In a document classification task, we are given a document (a sentence) and we need to clasify it into predifined categories. For example classyfi movie revie as positive or negative. A common apprach is to create a vector representation for each word in the document, merge it into a document representation and make a prediction out of it.

There are two types of representations. Local, like one hot encoding, and distributed. 
We will focus on the distributed. Currently, there are two main ways of obtaining distributional representation. 
In count based aproaches, we construct a coocurence matrix of  words in documents (or kontexts).
